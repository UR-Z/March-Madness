Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2025/overview

Yearly attempt at predicting march madness outcomes. The hypothesis started with a conversation with my wife, who was a NCAA coach for nearly a decade. When asked how she assessed the strength of a team, she mentioned turnover from the graduating class and coaches. The logic was that a new coach would need a few years to fill their team's roster with their recruits and that a trailing X years stats may have a pattern following graduation cycles.

For feature selection I broke down the logic as following:
- The last 3 years worth of game stats should be used
- An indicator whether a coach had been with the team the year before
- Previous year seed

Only point was defined and used for the Kaggle submission
